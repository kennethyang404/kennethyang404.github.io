description: An entirely new bulletin board, an everyone-to-everyone platform for communication.<p>On Facebook or Twitter, your post can only be seen by your friends or followers, but on this platform, everybody can send messages to anyone else. Built with a weighted-random rank algorithm, this system guarantees that the news with high weight has a greater chance of showing up on first page, but new posts also have a possibility to appear. When users go to the detailed page or click like, weight of the news will increase.<p>Also, to prevent spam information, a naive bayesian classifier is used.<p>This platform can be used in many situations. Such as posting college events information or publishing independent news.<p>Built with JS and Flask on HackCMU 2014
